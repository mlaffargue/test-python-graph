# python-graph-powering
Testing python programming.

* Create several Node class instances
  - Each node has:
    - an ID
    - a state (open / close). Closed means the power won't be transfered to children
    - a list of children Nodes
    - a "powered" information, false by default
* Link some random nodes
* Add power to random nodes and their children

Result is saved in a file

Possible evolutions:
  - Add multi-threading
